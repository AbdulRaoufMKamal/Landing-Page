                            This may sound obvious but it is all too easy to answer parts a and b of a question but

                            Another common mistake is to misread the question very slightly and therefore get the
                            answer wrong.

                            This is particularly true with calculator questions – write down everything you type
                            into your calculator just in case you have made a mistake somewhere. Most GCSE and IGCSE
                            questions have some marks for correct working even if the answer is wrong.

                            question. Be careful not to mix up rounding to 3 decimal places with rounding to 3

                            Learning about energy, electricity, forces or even worse – particle models may seem like
                            learning about abstract things, far from our everyday interactions with the world.
                            However, they are not – the abstract knowledge you learn in class is the ground bases of
                            every digital and mechanical construction in our world. Every mobile phone, computer and
                            car has been designed by somebody who made their first steps into understanding our
                            physical world at a young age – just like you are doing now.

                            cutting corners go far beyond that a letter to your parents, or a bad grade ever could.
